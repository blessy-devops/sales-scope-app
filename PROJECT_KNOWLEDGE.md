### Database Schema
Key tables include:
- `channels` - Sales channel definitions (e-commerce, marketplace, landing pages)
- `daily_sales` - Daily sales records per channel
- `sales_targets` - Monthly sales targets per channel
- `target_history` - Audit log for target changes
- `user_profiles` - Extended user information
- `user_preferences` - User customization settings
- `anomaly_logs` - Automated anomaly detection records
- `daily_observations` - Manual daily notes and observations

## üéØ Core Features

### 1. Dashboard Analytics (`/`)

Key Metrics Displayed:
- Total sales realized vs monthly targets
- Performance percentage (ahead/behind expected pace)
- Remaining target amount and percentage
- Daily rhythm metrics (current, projected, required)
- Channel-specific performance breakdown

### 2. Sales Entry (`/sales`)

- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on data entry
- **Sales Summary**: Live calculation of totals and channel breakdown
- **Edit Capability**: Modify previously entered sales data

### 3. Target Management (`/targets`)
- **Monthly Target Setting**: Define sales targets per channel per month
- **Historical View**: Access and modify targets for any month/year
- **Target Copying**: Replicate previous month's targets
- **Change Tracking**: Complete audit trail of target modifications
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficiently set targets across multiple channels

- `AnomalyAlertsCard` - Anomaly detection display and management
- `TargetHistoryPanel` - Target change history visualization

## üìä Business Logic & Calculations

### Performance Metrics
- **Expected Target**: (Monthly Target √∑ Days in Month) √ó Days Passed
- **Performance Value**: Realized Sales - Expected Target
- **Performance Percentage**: (Performance Value √∑ Expected Target) √ó 100
- **Remaining Target**: Monthly Target - Realized Sales

### Rhythm Analysis
- **Current Pace**: Total Sales √∑ Days Passed
- **Projected Total**: Current Pace √ó Total Days in Month
- **Required Pace**: Remaining Target √∑ Days Remaining
- **Projected Percentage**: (Projected Total √∑ Monthly Target) √ó 100

### Date Reference Modes
- **D-1 Mode**: Uses yesterday as reference date (default)
- **D0 Mode**: Uses today as reference date
- **Custom Periods**: Supports multi-month analysis and historical data
